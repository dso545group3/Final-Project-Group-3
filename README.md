# DSO545 Final Project Group 3

## Exploring data
The exploredata_1.R ,exploredata_2.R and exploredata_3.R give plots that help us to start visualizing the dataset at the very beginning. 

Then we have leaflet.R, Tab1Shinylocal.R and Tab2Shinylocal.R files which include the code to help establish our shiny, which is our main focus.

## Shiny
Since we are helping 311 to solve problems, so we think it will be a good idea to create a
product that could further developed by their technicians and easy to deployed at 311 to improve the quality and efficiency of 
its services that delivered to citizens.
